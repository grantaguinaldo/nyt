But then crude oil and gasoline prices tanked. Now, the future of CNG cars looks a lot less certain.  It hardly got any attention, but late last week FuelMaker, the Honda-owned maker of natural gas fueling systems -- including a residential model called the ""Phill"" -- filed for bankruptcy.  Clean Energy Fuels, a natural gas distributor owned by T. Boone Pickens, had been trying to buy the company from Honda for $17 million, but the two sides could never make a deal. The Phill, which has been on the market about six years, never caught on. Perhaps that is because it takes four hours to fill an empty tank with the device, and it costs up to $6,000.  An even bigger problem for FuelMaker might have been the fact that very few drivers own CNG vehicles. Most are fleet cars, buses and trucks owned by companies and public transportation agencies. And, of course, few gasoline filling stations offer compressed natural gas.   At the moment, the Honda Civic GX is the only CNG car on the market, and it is available at only a select number of dealerships in a few states including California and New York. ",nyt
